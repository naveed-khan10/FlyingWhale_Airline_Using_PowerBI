#Data_Overview: The project involved analyzing two datasets: one on customer flight bookings and the other on loyalty program history, covering loyalty points, demographics, and membership details.

Goal: Flying Whale Airline wanted to use this data to improve customer experience, identify travel trends, and optimize its loyalty program.

Flight Activity Analysis: This part focused on seasonal booking trends, the connection between flight distance and loyalty points, and how companions impact point redemption.

Loyalty Segmentation Analysis: Insights were gained by analyzing loyalty status, demographics, and behavior, like flights booked with loyalty cards and average distances traveled by different loyalty tiers.

Membership Trends Analysis: This involved studying regional differences in membership duration before cancellation, seasonal cancellation trends, and how demographics relate to cancellation rates.

Recommendations and Strategies: Strategies included addressing seasonal patterns, improving loyalty programs, customizing offers based on demographics, using geographic strategies, and making decisions based on data and feedback.

Conclusion: By understanding travel trends, customer preferences, and regional variations, Flying Whale Airline can enhance its loyalty program, create personalized experiences, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty over time.
